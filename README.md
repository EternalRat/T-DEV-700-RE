# Cash Manager
# Context

We had to create a mobile application solution that would allow us to pay for different content.
We chose to be a company, so we needed only one TPE for now at least.
Because of that, right now there is no way to add a new TPE.

Since it's in a company, there's no reason to have a queue system on the TPE so only one person can pay at the same time.
